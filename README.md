Discription

I first chose what I thought was a good colour scheme for the site that I thought look unique and interesting,
next I made a mockup on what I thought I would want for a portfolio website for myself to look like.
Then I started coding and made my site what it is right now.

One of the main challenges I faced was how to do css animations, the way I overcame this challenge was to go back to
the videos and my old code pen and re study how to do it and how it worked, I also watched some Youtube tutorials and
that gave me a few ideas and helped me learn quickly as well.

What I have learned creating my web portfolio is
that making a responsive website for all sizes can be difficult
and take a long time, but I find it is very worth the effort in the end.
